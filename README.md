###### Making events great again.
###### Making Android great again.
###### Making Xiaomi great again.

### Short description
A web and mobile application that helps people at events put all their pictures together.

### Motivation
People take lots of photos at events, and then forget to share them. People attend events and would like to see all the pictures that were taken in there in one place. Would there be any way to automate this process and centralize it?

### Architecture
Android app in Java, looks out for new pictures taken and uploads them as soon as they are taken (has a toggle to pause auto-upload). PHP server that get the serialized picture and displays it. Web interface to create new events and set the password for users who are in the event location get notified to upload their picture.

### Technichal
```app``` contains the Android Studio source files.


```server``` contains the Laravel web server files.
